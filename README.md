# TypeScript Fundamentals

TypeScript is the "new" language Microsoft introduced in 2014 for easier and more quality JavaScript. Actually, TypeScript is a language that is compiled to pure, everywhere-working JavaScript, even on Internet Explorer 7 and 8.

In this course we will cover the fundamentals of TypeScript: data types, loops, conditionals, arrays and more. These topics are absolutely necessary for the complete understanding of the language and fundamental for technologies like [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/).
